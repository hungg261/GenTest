# GenTest

GenTest is a simple Windows-only console GUI for generating and validating problem tests.  
It allows you to generate inputs and outputs, validate them, and edit generator/solver/validator files easily.



## Download

**Make sure you have `g++` installed (part of MinGW or similar) and added to your PATH.**



1. Download the zip file from GitHub, extract it then run `GenTest.exe`.
   
   If there is no `GenTest.exe`, compile `GenTest.cpp` and run:
   
   ```batch
   g++ GenTest.cpp -o GenTest.exe
   ```

2. After that, the main menu will appear, and magic starts.
